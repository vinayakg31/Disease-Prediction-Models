# 🧠 Disease Prediction Models

This repository contains machine learning models for predicting the risk of three critical diseases:

- ❤️ Heart Attack
- 🧬 Meningitis
- 🩺 Diabetes

These models are built using structured datasets and machine learning techniques to provide early-stage risk prediction. The goal is to assist in awareness and early medical intervention.

## 🌐 Web Application

A user-friendly **web application** has also been developed for these prediction models. Users can:

- Select the disease (Heart Attack / Meningitis / Diabetes)
- Input relevant health information
- Get real-time prediction results

This makes the models accessible to users without technical backgrounds.
